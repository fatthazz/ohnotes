<p><strong>Babylon</strong></p>
<p><em>Fallen, fallen, fallen is Babylon the great</em><br /><em>Space is getting bounded, time is getting late, getting late</em></p>
<p><em>Masters fall and wonder</em><br /><em>People rise and wait</em><br /><em>Fallen, fallen, fallen is Babylon the great</em></p>
<p><em>You don't need a coin, I don't have to shine</em><br /><em>We don't know the reason, but I need you madly</em><br /><em>But you need me too, and we need each other</em><br /><em>Need each other, need each other</em></p>
<p><em>-Babylon from '666'&nbsp; Aphrodite Child(1972)</em></p>
<p>Before Vangelis known as 'Vangelis', he was a member (keyboards and flutes) of Aphrodite Child, a progressive rock band that was formed in 1967 and disbanded in 1972 despite having sold over 20 million records and remaining popular throughout Europe. I also heard during the production of '666' album, Vangelis describe it was a awful and dishonest.</p>
